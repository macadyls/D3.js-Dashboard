# D3 Times Dashboard

The project analyses current trends of health risks in the US. The findings can be viewed through an animated scatterplot diagram where the axes can be changed according to the variable in question.

The dataset used is based on [2014 ACS 1-year estimates](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml)

Each circle represents a state in the US and also acts as a tooltip; when hovered over, the exact x-value and y-value will be shown along with the state name.
